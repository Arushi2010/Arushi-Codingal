        <h4><font color="#FFFFFF", size="">Wolves (Canis lupus) are majestic and highly intelligent predators that play a vital role in maintaining ecological balance.They live in packs, usually consisting of 6–10 members, and are led by an alpha pair who guide the group's hunting and social structure. Their communication is complex, using howls, body language, and scent markings to coordinate and express emotions.

            <h4><font color="#FFFFFF">As carnivores, they rely on strategic teamwork to hunt prey such as deer, elk, and moose, showcasing their remarkable problem-solving skills. Wolves are fast runners, reaching speeds of 40–60 km/h (25–37 mph) in bursts, and their powerful jaws can exert nearly 1,500 psi of bite force.
